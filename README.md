# MachineLearning-Demos

Welcome to my *MachineLearning-Demos* repository! This collection showcases my journey through various machine learning concepts and techniques, as learned in the *CMPUT 267* course. The notebooks here document my hands-on experience with different machine learning algorithms and methodologies, providing insight into what I have learned and how I applied the theoretical concepts to practical problems.

This repository isn't a tutorial collection; rather, it's a documentation of my own learning and experimentation. Each demo notebook is a result of the material covered in class, where I took the time to understand the principles, work through problems, and build solutions. Below, I will detail some of the topics and concepts I explored during this course.
